# Centre of Attention: Solution



## Theory
There is only minimal maths involved here in calculating neighbours and determining whether a given pixel is on the edge of the image.

## Strategy
1. Clearly, we are going to ignore all pixels that do not match the specified colour.

2. Getting the pixels as a one-dimensional array is somewhat counterintuitive. Converting it to a 2D array first would make things easier, but it'll effectively add another iteration, which is problematic given that we know that performance if a factor to consider. Strategy: solve it in with the help of 2D conversion, then refactor.

3. Since performance is an issue, we want to minimise  
a) the number of iterations through the original array (the instructiosn kindly tell us that 2 are sufficient) and  
b) the number of the number of pixels whose depth we actually test.

We'll figure out a) as we go. As far is b) is concerned, here are some initial observations:
- Any pixel on the edge of the image will have a depth of 1.
- Any pixel neighbouring a pixel of a different colour will have a depth of 1.
- Any other pixel will be surrounded by pixels of the same colour, at its depth will be the minimum of it's neighbouring pixels' depths +1.
- Even if we haven't calculated the depth for a all of a pixel's neighbours yet, we know that if it has a neighbour (of the same colour) of some depth d, it's own depth will be <= d + 1.

Having made these observations, how can we determine the depth for every pixel of the specified colour with just two iterations (discounting the one we need for conversion)?

Idea: iterate forwards the first time and backwards the second time!  

The first time, for each pixel of the specified colour, we will only check the pixel to its _top_ and the pixel to its _left_ - i.e. those that have already been checked. If either neighbour a) does not exist (because the pixel is on an edge) or b) has a different colour, we assign a (final) depth of 1; otherwise, we assign a provisinoal depth of the minimum of its neighbours' depths + 1. Note that while it is tempting to already keep track of the current maximum depth, we cannot do this as some of our provisionally calculated depths may be too high!  

The second time, we start with the bottom-right pixel and work our way backwards to the top-left. This time, we can also ignore all pixels that do have the right colour but have a depth of 1. For each pixel of the right colour with a depth > 1, we will now check its _right_ and its _bottom_ neighbour. Again, if either is undefined or of a different colour.  
This time, we _will_ keep track of the current maximum depth in order to avoid further iterations. We will do this as follows:  
1. Create a variable to keep track of the current maximum depth, initialised at 1 (any number < 1 works too).
2. Create an empty array to collect the indices of our central pixels.
3. During the (second) iteration, proceed as follows:
    - If the current pixel's depth equals the current max, add its index to the array.
    - If the current pixel's depth is _higher than_ the current maximum, set the maximum to the pixel's depth and replace the array with one containing only the current index.

This should work. The indices in our final array will be in reverse order, but the instructions make it clear that we needn't worry about that.

Let's do this!

## Implementation

### First draft

#### Conversion

For our first draft, let's make our lives a bit easier and represent our data as a 2-dimensional matrix rather than a 1-dimensional array.

**NOTE:** Although each pixel is uniquely identified by a pair of "coordinates" (i, j), these are not to be confused with its x and y coordinates within the picture. (We're counting TL-BR)

#### First iteration
There is no way around it: we need to iterate over the entire array of pixels to start with.

After the first iteration, we get the following initial results for our example:

        [
            [1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
            [1, 2, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
            [1, 2, 2, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
            [1, 2, 3, 2, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
            [1, 2, 3, 3, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
            [1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0]
        ]

That's already pretty good! The only incorrect values at this point are (4, 2) and (4, 3), which should have a depth of 2. Since the shortest path to an edge or a pixel of a different colour must start with either a step right or a step down, we could not detect it during the first iteration.  

#### Second iteration

During the second iteration, we want to achieve two things:  
1. We want to fix any incorrect values in our initial array. For this purpose, we are going to iterate _backwards_ this time. Note that we don't even have to look at the original array anymore.
2. We want to keep track of the central pixels, i.e. those with the highest depth.



After the second loop, our `depths` matrix looks like this:

    [
      [1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
      [1, 2, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
      [1, 2, 2, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
      [1, 2, 3, 2, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
      [1, 2, 2, 2, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
      [1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0]
    ]

Spot on! Now all we have to do is find all occurrences of the highest value and, in this solution, translate their 2D coordinates back into a 1D index. We could, of course, use another loop here, but that's actually not necessary - we can already do that during our second loop:

_Et voil√†_, our solution passes not only the sample tests indeed the kata autor's full test suite (which, as per the instructions, includes a `Big_Test` suite using a 16-megapixel image in the JS version). Completion took **1226ms** for my first attempt, which are spread across the 5 test suites as follows:
| Test Suite | Completion Time |
| --- | --- |
| Example_In_The_Picture | 3ms |
| Circular_Disc_Test | 11ms |
| Diagonal_Test | 3ms |
| Random_Tests | 35ms |
| Big_Test | 1174ms |
